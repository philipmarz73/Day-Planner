# Day-Planner

This Project involved the construction of a simple calendar application, a Day Planner or "Work Day Scheduler" which would allow the User to add important Events to a 'typical' 9AM to 5PM workday template. Upon opening, the application announces its function in the Header, along with the current date. Scrolling down reveals long horizontal time blocks which can receive text. These time blocks are labeled along the left-hand margin with the hour of the workday, starting at 9AM and ending at 5PM, as mentioned. Along the right-hand margin are blue-colored tabs with 'lock' symbols that, when clicked, allow the User to store his text in local storage and to persist on the page, even after refreshing the page.

One notable feature of this application is the ability to determine 'at a glance' which is the current hour of the day, based on the color coding of the text fields. A bright red signals the current hour, gray fields denote previous hours, and bright green marks the fields of the hours to come.


# Project Motivation 

Besides offering practice in using jQuery to dynamically update and render HTML and CSS, it allowed me to become familiar with the Moment.js library to keep track of, and update the current time and date. It was a chance to generate an application with immediate practical use, and with enough features to take it a step farther than generic schedulers. It's solid basic structure would enable one to add more features and increase its functionality easily.
